# Summarize time spend on tasks

## What is Jiffy?
Jiffy is an App that lets you record your working hours for several projects.
It has a free version (used here) and offers a paid version.

## What does this script do?
The free version lets you see the last 3 weeks of your history. With this R script
you can visualize and summarize your whole history.

## How to do it
Step 1: Install Jiffy on your mobile device. Create projects that you would like
to record the duration for. The script should handle any number of projects, 
however the plots will have space for two, three, maybe even four projects.

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON
